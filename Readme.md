This analysis is performed to examine the effects of various features on the sale price of houses located in different regions of U.S.A.. In order to make this happen, the following steps are taken.

1. Dataset
The key step of every data analysis challange is finding a way to obtain trustable and appropriate information being completely relevant to that project. Conducting online and in-person questionnaire surveys, studying relevant academic papers, and surfing the most popular website in this field, www.kaggle.com, are the most common approaches being adopted by researchers and engineers to construct useful datasets. Therefore, an existing dataset from Kaggele (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) is chosen to perform a through analysis for the current project.

2. Feature Investigation
It is critical for data anlysts to find clear comprehensions about every different features being used in the dataset on which they are working. In this regard, there must be technical discussions between clients and data analysts to get as much information as possible about the dataset. In some cases, it is required for data anlysts to conduct some market research to be fully aware of the meaning of every different features in the relevant industry. Kaggle, itself, provideded us with informative details and useful information regarding all features (keys and values) being used in the current dataset. For more information you are referred to an exisiting text file, data_description.txt, at https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

3. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Getting a good grasp on the dataset, data analysts are quite ready to start working on the project and it is often commenced by execution of feature engineering and data preprocessing. This is one of the most challanging steps of every data analysis projects and consequentely the adopted approaches in this step may vary person by person as well as project by project. Using our creativity, we have developed sevaral modules and packages to employ unique and practical techniques to quickly extract useful information from any kind of structured dataset.

4. Machine Learning Execution
After performing data preprocessing, machine learning techniques are implemented in order to develop automated forcasting/estimator systems.
